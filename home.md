# The Clandestine Providence

The majority of the Clandestine Providence takes place in today's world.  The history is the same, the places and people act the same.  The world is almost unchanged, except that supernatural creatures are real.  Magic is real.  The impossible is now possible.  But as a human you'd never know.  That is the essence of the Clandestine Providence - the one law all supernatural creatures heed.  Keep humanity safe and outside of the occult.  The punishment for violating this law is death.  And the Venatori are there to uphold the law and extract the penalty despite the others view of them.
