# The Venatori

_from Latin for hunter: venator_

The Venatori are a supernatural race of 'humans' whose sole purpose is to police the supernatural world under the Clandestine Providence. Venatori are gifted with superhuman senses, strength, speed, endurance, agility, healing and typically some sort of mental 'enhancement'. ie: photographic memory, empathic, prophetic, precognition

Venatori complete the Ad Aetatem (coming of age) ritual at the age of 18.

The Venatori are ruled by the Imperordo. There are three branches/types of Venatori - the venatori (the hunters), The Scrin (the archivists), and the Magnus (magic users). The Magnus are the only branch that can be part of the hunters or the Scrin.

The Venatori descend from the Aeternus. They eradicated the Aeternus as a threat to their own survivabililty. They maintain their original purpose created by the Aeternus.

The Venatori are governed by The Imperordo - a representative from the 8 ruling families and the most powerful Magnus of the Venatori

Over the centuries the Venatori have loosened their breeding programs started by the Aeternus thus allowing half human children, also known as Minorem

## Humans in the Venatori

Humans are not typically raised to be venatori, they are usually found after having been traumatized by a supernatural event that their only real course of survival is to become one. A human venatori must go through the Ad Aetatem, typically done after 5 years of intensive training, however those raised from a child are treated as Minorem.

## Venatori Compound Locations

The Venatori are a world wide organization, they have six headquarters.

New York, New York - This facility is the training ground for all Venatori They also monitor the Eastern US and Canada.
Boulder, Colorado - The Rocky Mountain facility monitors the Western North American mountain Ranges and Mexico for their unique supernatural creatures. They also offer training in survival at extremes.
London, England - The Island facility monitors all of the European supernatural creatures
Beijing, China - The Asian facility monitors all of Asia and Japan
Sydney, Austrailia - The Outback facility monitors the southern hemisphere island supernatural creatures, and also offers training in some of the deadliest creatures supernatural and mundane alike
Basilia, Brazil - The Brazilian facility monitors all of South and Central American supernatural creatures.

## Training

Most Venatori are trained from birth to police the supernatural. It starts out simple, taught by their parents, until they are 13 years old, then they are sent to their special training facility in New York where they are taught how to hunt, kill and/or capture the supernatural elements of the world. They spend 5 years training before they are let out into the world to do their work.

When individuals outside the Venatori shows promise, or has befallen a great tragedy at the hands of the supernatural, the Venatori have a choice, they can wipe the memories from the victim, or pull them into the Venatori. My most Venatori standards it is more harmful to wipe a memory than it is to teach them their way. But not everyone is cut out to hunt monsters, so mind wiping had become the default practice except for children who's minds are still highly impressionable.

Venatori who are also Magnus are subject to different training and different rules as they are firstly governed by the Magnus branch. However the Venatori and Magnus work together in close proximity training all Magnus in the NYC facility.

## Financial Situations

The Venatori are funded by various holding subsidiaries owned by the 'race' as a whole. The Venatori individuals do not own have money of their 'own' to speak of. It's a matter of providing for the whole. A person works, they are given a stipend for extras - things like extraneous furnishings, dinners out of the various compounds, extravagance and luxuries. All basic living necessities are provided for on the compound. If a Venatori chooses to live out of the compound they are given a yearly salary and are required to pay for everything with that salary.

As an individuals status raises in the Venatori certain extras are given to a person. A single person is given a studio apartment on the first level of the adult residences. A single person with one to two children living with them is afforded a two bedroom apartment on that same level. Three or more children regardless of the number of parents is given a three bedroom place on the second level of the adult residences.

A committed couple with no children is given a one bedroom apartment on the second level. A committed couple with less than three children is given a two bedroom on the second level. A couple with more children is given a three bedroom on the third level of the adult residences.

The above is regardless of status. The higher the status of a person higher the person moves up in extravagance of their living arrangements. A single person with high status can live in the lap of luxury all on the Venatori dime.
